* Reading Peirce

Readings of Peirce with brief comments on them.

** [[https://rs.cms.hu-berlin.de/peircearchive/pages/view.php?ref=987][The Boolian Calculus]] (2 pages)
Peirce on how Boolian algebra could be of use to both mathematicians and logicians.
He cites the use of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schubert_calculus][Schubert’s geometry]] as an example of making geometry tractable through boolean algebra.

Peirce writes about reducing the number of signs used in Boolean algebra and uses a notation in which there is only one constant present.
An true assertion is denoted as P and it's negation as PP. Then elimination and development of this is performed on according to stipulated rules.
Can’t help but wonder if this is related to his Peirce Arrow (NOR operator) in some way.
